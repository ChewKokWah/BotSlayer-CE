# BotSlayer Community Edition (BotSlayer-CE)

The "CE" version of BotSlayer is not meant for research, as it uses simple heuristics to calculate bot scores. We strongly recommend the "Pro" version of BotSlayer, which has proprietary BotometerLite software and many other improvements. It is available for free, but will share data with Indiana University for research purposes.
